# EasyTARC
EasyTARC is a local Windows application for keeping track of the time spent on individual projects, meetings, etc. during your working hours.

EasyTARC - Easy time accounts recording control - This is my first opensource project. With the help of this project I want to improve my knowledge of the programming language Python and the framework Tkinter, as well as familiarize myself with the development of desktop applications.

While working, the work window function is useful to keep track of time and still be able to work with concentration, you can choose between two work windows and also switch at any time.
Here you can see the bar window:

Installation instructions:

To get a first impression of EasyTARC, download the latest release and put the files into your preferred directory. Then go to the folder Version_X_X_EXE and execute the file EasyTARC.exe.

You like EasyTARC and want to use it in your team or company? 
Then these are your next steps:

The executable files in the folder Version_X_X_EXE are great for a first impression, but there are still dummy hash complements in the source code. You can use the Windows PowerShell with the command "pyinstaller -F -w -i "Logo.ico" EasyTARC.py".

The development of the app took place for the most part not in this repository, but in a non-public repository.
