Please note that these EXE files (EasyTARC and User_License_Creator) are only intended as examples. 
The encryption contains the example passwords from the code in Github. 
If you want to use the mulitple_users_encrypted configuration securely, 
you must change the example passwords in the code and generate the EXE files yourself using pyinstaller, for example.
